        "To whomever is reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! üòÅ\n\nIf you were to suddenly die this very moment where do you think you would spend eternity?? If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and he sent his Son Jesus to die for your sins that you would not perish but have eternal LIFE!!\n\nGod came to me, saved me and filled me with his spirit when I was at a low point in my life a few years ago. God will do the same for you if you allow him. You have a choice, but YOU ARE GODS CHOICE and he will NEVER CHANGE! He wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! He loves you!\n\nThe bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is death! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9,13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!\n\nIm going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...\n\nDear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus is the son of God and that you died and rose again and are coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I have a home in heaven because Jesus is in my heart!\n\nFriend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because Jesus Loves You and has a plan for your life!! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tBR2nCS5zFI\n\nIf you prayed with me, plz type amen!",

I believe that Jesus is the son of God and that you died and rose again and are coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I have a home in heaven because Jesus is in my heart!\n\nFriend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because Jesus Loves You and has a plan for your life!! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tBR2nCS5zFI\n\nIf you prayed with me, plz type amen!",

        "I looked, and behold, a white horse [of victory] whose rider carried a bow; and a crown [of victory] was given to him, and he rode forth conquering and to conquer.  When He (the Lamb) broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, ‚ÄúCome.‚Äù And another, a fiery red horse [of bloodshed], came out; and its rider was empowered to take peace from the earth, so that men would slaughter one another; and a great sword [of war and violent death] was given to him.  When He (the Lamb) broke open the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, ‚ÄúCome.‚Äù I looked, and behold, a black horse [of famine]; and the rider had in his hand a pair of scales (a balance). And I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, ‚ÄúA quart of wheat for a denarius (a day‚Äôs wages), and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine.‚Äù  When He (the Lamb) broke open the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature call out, ‚ÄúCome.‚Äù So I looked, and behold, an ashen (pale greenish gray) horse [like a corpse, representing death and pestilence]; and its rider‚Äôs name was Death; and Hades (the realm of the dead) was following with him. They were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague (pestilence, disease) and by the wild beasts of the earth.\r\nRevelation 6:2‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨8 AMP\r\nhttps://bible.com/bible/1588/rev.6.2-8.AMP",

This could also be the case for this version, as she cleans silkie with her tongue.\n\nI saw someone saying she had 9 stomachs, and that that could be a reason that she doesn‚Äôt have a belly button and someone else wasn‚Äôt sure about the 9 stomachs because of Teen Titans Go. She does have 9 belly buttons, as mentioned in Mother Mae-Eye",

        "I saw a comment saying something about Starfire without a belly button and some people commenting weird stuff and theories about Starfire on that comment.\n\nThe best site for information about the teen titans, is this fandom page: https://teentitans.fandom.com/wiki/Teen_Titans\n\nI looked some things up for the people in the comments.\n\n\nStarfires belly button was shown for one second in one episode, I just don‚Äôt remember which one.\n\nAlso, her animation sheet does have a belly button. \n\nI saw some comments saying she was born out of an eggs because she is een alien, but she isn‚Äôt born out of an egg, since in the early comics her race were descendants of cat-like creatures. This could also be the case for this version, as she cleans silkie with her tongue.\n\nI saw someone saying she had 9 stomachs, and that that could be a reason that she doesn‚Äôt have a belly button and someone else wasn‚Äôt sure about the 9 stomachs because of Teen Titans Go. She does have 9 belly buttons, as mentioned in Mother Mae-Eye",

        "@Death 786 No, just no! It's not coming back. Don't believe me, read what Alex Hirsch has to say: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/961400040433508352",
        "Honestly Calobi is going insane, I love gravity falls, but my god he needs to cool down about this.\n- - - - - - - \nIf you haven't watched his 'questionable' Video posted on Jan 3, 2020 called \"Gravity Falls Could Still Come BACK in 2020! Season 3\" then go check out his video.\nI left a comment in his video explaining why gravity falls might not get a Season 3, however crossovers and adaptations are possible (AKA the *Singular* episode in Amphibia). I also not necessary debunked, since i didn't go into detail, but i instead listed the obvious facilities.\n- - - - - - - - -\nCompared to the Jan 3 video, his production / skill in making video's has increased significantly. He did a good job as well as listing a source \"The Netflix Contract\". Despite all this I still have some problems with this video so let me list them again.\n- - - - - - - - -\n1. 0:37 - You might have researched this for 4 years (Show ended in 2016), however there is no \"Coded Secret\" in this video.\n2. 1:18 - Alex Hirsch has done a lot since gravity falls, both him & his team helped in the making of The Owl House.\n3. 1:30 - If you search \"What is Alex Hirsch doing right now\" you'll find that Calobi edited the original post. The netflix deal was from 2018, for a show called ‚ÄòInside Job‚Äô, that's labeled as a adult/comedy animation. (https://www.netflix.com/title/80995819) We all now since Gravity falls was aired on Disney XD, it certainly wasn't \"a adult animation\".\n4. 1:30 - Disney still owns Gravity Falls, not Netflix, not Alex Hitsch. How do I this well here's Alex Hitsch to tell you so (https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/1140372266707853312?lang=en). Whats this mean? Well if we did get a gravity falls adaptation/crossover/season 3, Disney would most likely air it. We would not see Alex Hirsch partnering with Netflix for a Season 3, Disney would have to partner with Netflix.\n4. 1:52 - To answer your question @Calobi Productions \"That show\" is 'Inside Job' and it will be coming to netflix.\n5. 3:40 - He's making moves for new shows, he loves gravity falls and he'll always love what fan's make. However he has started many times DIRECTLY on twitter that he hates being asked about S3. (He's not dropping anything into anyone's subconscious)\n6. 5:54 - Alex Hirsch didn't bring back the shack, Disney did, as the image states Alex Hirsch was a guest star. However Disney owns the rights and the crossover for Amphibia lasted 1 episode.\n7. 6:20 - Gravity falls was amazing and is held high in the eyes of the community, of course as long as gravity falls is relevant there will be cross overs.\n8. 7:08 - The reasoning is that Disney owns the rights, its a Disney show. Alex Hirsch no-matter what is one man, a man who does not own the rights to gravity falls, a man who is working on many shows, and a man who is legally binded to only make gravity falls contact for Disney.\n9.12:50 - There is no evidence of it coming back. There's evidence of crossovers, but there is no real evidence in this video. Almost all of the so called evidence are FAN-MADE Video or edited over to appeal real.\n- - - - - - - - - -  \nWhy Gravity falls might not NEVER return.\nIf you have been keeping up Alex Hirsch you might have heard of \"#DisPurge\".\nWell long story short Disney might be getting rid of Gravity Falls from Its streaming services to make room for new ones. If this is done with Gravity Falls then we'll have confirmation of Disney (THE OWNERS OF GRAVITY FALLS) that they intend on no longer working on the series.\n- - - - - - - - - -\nI appreciated giving people hope, however I'd appreciate it more if Colobi gave real evidence, or covering topic surrounding the show instead of over-hyping fake news.\nI love gravity falls Id love to see them not get Purged & for a remake, But please dont give people a false hope, and dont try to discredit all the comments from your last gravity falls video. (There not \"Gravity Falls Haters\" if anything it shows that they love the show & are upset with your content)",

        "@Jerry Glen lovell I'm not a psychic, but what I do have is research and facts to back me! \n\n1. Alex confirmed Bill's defeat (and death) in this tweet: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/973037978346864641\n\nand 2. Alex AGAIN disproved season 3 in that same tweet! He also did so here: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/978705988533469184\n\nAnd not only that, but he wrote a comprehensive blog back in 2015, explaining why GF had to end! \n\nhttps://shmalexsmirsch.tumblr.com/post/133619326491/goodbye-gravity-falls\n\nAnd just in case you say that's not Alex Hirsch...here's proof that it's him!! \n\nhttps://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/667843799129812992\n\nAnd again, just cause I can: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/961400040433508352",

Or is this just the norm? Like they all have to agree to you not using their names in the episodes? If that's the case I at least understand the reasoning behind it even if I don't agree.\nOh, and to be fair here's the video the writer made: https://youtu.be/EeHzGEgDcig\nIf you guys will be checking that out scroll down to the comments section, Mat Pat left a comment explaining himself, which (in my opinion) pretty nice.",

        "@Death 786 No, just no! It's not coming back. Don't believe me, read what Alex Hirsch has to say: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/961400040433508352",
        "Honestly Calobi is going insane, I love gravity falls, but my god he needs to cool down about this.\n- - - - - - - \nIf you haven't watched his 'questionable' Video posted on Jan 3, 2020 called \"Gravity Falls Could Still Come BACK in 2020! Season 3\" then go check out his video.\nI left a comment in his video explaining why gravity falls might not get a Season 3, however crossovers and adaptations are possible (AKA the *Singular* episode in Amphibia). I also not necessary debunked, since i didn't go into detail, but i instead listed the obvious facilities.\n- - - - - - - - -\nCompared to the Jan 3 video, his production / skill in making video's has increased significantly. He did a good job as well as listing a source \"The Netflix Contract\". Despite all this I still have some problems with this video so let me list them again.\n- - - - - - - - -\n1. 0:37 - You might have researched this for 4 years (Show ended in 2016), however there is no \"Coded Secret\" in this video.\n2. 1:18 - Alex Hirsch has done a lot since gravity falls, both him & his team helped in the making of The Owl House.\n3. 1:30 - If you search \"What is Alex Hirsch doing right now\" you'll find that Calobi edited the original post. The netflix deal was from 2018, for a show called ‚ÄòInside Job‚Äô, that's labeled as a adult/comedy animation. (https://www.netflix.com/title/80995819) We all now since Gravity falls was aired on Disney XD, it certainly wasn't \"a adult animation\".\n4. 1:30 - Disney still owns Gravity Falls, not Netflix, not Alex Hitsch. How do I this well here's Alex Hitsch to tell you so (https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/1140372266707853312?lang=en). Whats this mean? Well if we did get a gravity falls adaptation/crossover/season 3, Disney would most likely air it. We would not see Alex Hirsch partnering with Netflix for a Season 3, Disney would have to partner with Netflix.\n4. 1:52 - To answer your question @Calobi Productions \"That show\" is 'Inside Job' and it will be coming to netflix.\n5. 3:40 - He's making moves for new shows, he loves gravity falls and he'll always love what fan's make. However he has started many times DIRECTLY on twitter that he hates being asked about S3. (He's not dropping anything into anyone's subconscious)\n6. 5:54 - Alex Hirsch didn't bring back the shack, Disney did, as the image states Alex Hirsch was a guest star. However Disney owns the rights and the crossover for Amphibia lasted 1 episode.\n7. 6:20 - Gravity falls was amazing and is held high in the eyes of the community, of course as long as gravity falls is relevant there will be cross overs.\n8. 7:08 - The reasoning is that Disney owns the rights, its a Disney show. Alex Hirsch no-matter what is one man, a man who does not own the rights to gravity falls, a man who is working on many shows, and a man who is legally binded to only make gravity falls contact for Disney.\n9.12:50 - There is no evidence of it coming back. There's evidence of crossovers, but there is no real evidence in this video. Almost all of the so called evidence are FAN-MADE Video or edited over to appeal real.\n- - - - - - - - - -  \nWhy Gravity falls might not NEVER return.\nIf you have been keeping up Alex Hirsch you might have heard of \"#DisPurge\".\nWell long story short Disney might be getting rid of Gravity Falls from Its streaming services to make room for new ones. If this is done with Gravity Falls then we'll have confirmation of Disney (THE OWNERS OF GRAVITY FALLS) that they intend on no longer working on the series.\n- - - - - - - - - -\nI appreciated giving people hope, however I'd appreciate it more if Colobi gave real evidence, or covering topic surrounding the show instead of over-hyping fake news.\nI love gravity falls Id love to see them not get Purged & for a remake, But please dont give people a false hope, and dont try to discredit all the comments from your last gravity falls video. (There not \"Gravity Falls Haters\" if anything it shows that they love the show & are upset with your content)",

        "@Jerry Glen lovell I'm not a psychic, but what I do have is research and facts to back me! \n\n1. Alex confirmed Bill's defeat (and death) in this tweet: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/973037978346864641\n\nand 2. Alex AGAIN disproved season 3 in that same tweet! He also did so here: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/978705988533469184\n\nAnd not only that, but he wrote a comprehensive blog back in 2015, explaining why GF had to end! \n\nhttps://shmalexsmirsch.tumblr.com/post/133619326491/goodbye-gravity-falls\n\nAnd just in case you say that's not Alex Hirsch...here's proof that it's him!! \n\nhttps://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/667843799129812992\n\nAnd again, just cause I can: https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/961400040433508352",

        "Thanks Dave. I grew up watching Looney Tunes and the Road Runner shorts were always my faves.\nLoved the video.\nI know u dont cover video game appearances (your videos would be a lot longer if u did) but i think a mention is meritted to  the 1985 arcade game of Road Runner. It really captured the premise and the characters so well and I was OBSESSED with it, spending so much of my pocket money on it but very much like Wile himself, I never succeeded at my aim to win. Couldnt get past level 5.\nThe interesting thing in the game was that you control the road runner not Wile. So whilst it was always frustrating when you got caught it was simultaneously extremely satisfying to witness the Coyote actually capture his prey - maybe that was what got me so addicted to it. I know it was largely an unliked game due to its difficulty level and tricky to master control system but for me the challenging aspect mirrored what hooked me on the shorts in the first place.\nThe arcade game is viewable on Youtube\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dprbGfSttHU",

        "Ever since I had first watched this episode of the final seventh season of the 2003 TV series, I had often wondered why the writers and animators had the Turtles relocate to a different lair instead of having them still living in the third lair that they had them living in throughout the rest of season 4, season 5, the beginning of the first episode of season 6 and the end of the first episode of season 7. Donnie still would've had the extra space to build the cyber-portal.\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/3156/2892084417_250f9a11e9_b.jpg\n\nKhan is reminiscent of another character called Tatsu, who was introduced for the first and second live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films that were released in theaters on March 30th of 1990 and March 22nd of 1991 and reintroduced for the episode \"The Forgotten Swordsman\" of the final fifth season of the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles computer-animated TV series that was first aired on Nickelodeon on March 26th of 2017.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed watching the final seventh season myself, I would've preferred reintroducing Khan as Tatsu instead, because if you think about it, they're really not all that different from each other, except for their appearance, but their personalities are quite similar since they were both loyal to the Shredder and had intentions to rebuild the Foot. Plus, it would've been epic if the 2003 TV series also had it's own version of Tatsu. So, why not have him go by that name instead? I don't see any reason why not. Ever since then, I had wondered why the people who worked for 4Kids Entertainment didn't just go along with that."

        "They probably moved them through Free Ports. \n\n‚ÄúFree ports or zones are designated by the government as areas with little to no tax in order to encourage economic activity. While located geographically within a country, they essentially exist outside its borders for tax purposes.\nCompanies operating within free ports can benefit from deferring the payment of taxes until their products are moved elsewhere, or can avoid them altogether if they bring in goods to store or manufacture on site before exporting them again.‚Äù\n(From: https://amp.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/06/what-is-a-free-port-all-you-need-to-know-about-free-trade-zones-brexit )\n\nStolen and looted art and artifacts have been known to be trafficked and stored in free ports until they weren‚Äôt ‚Äòhot‚Äô anymore.\n\n‚ÄúThe European Commission in a report said that free ports were popular for the storage of art, precious stones, antiques, gold and wine as alternative assets to cash, and posed an emerging threat in multiple ways: allowing counterfeiters to land consignments and tamper with loads and paperwork, then re-export the products without customs formalities, disguising the actual origin and nature of the goods and their supplier. The commission said they were also used for narcotics trafficking, the illegal ivory trade, people smuggling, VAT fraud, corruption and money laundering.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs an example the commission cited Swiss authorities' 2016 seizure of cultural relics looted from the Middle East being stored in Geneva's free ports. The free port system has been accused of facilitating international art crime, allowing stolen artworks to remain undetected in storage for decades.‚Äù\n\n(From Wikipedia - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_economic_zone)",

        "They probably moved them through Free Ports. \n\n‚ÄúFree ports or zones are designated by the government as areas with little to no tax in order to encourage economic activity. While located geographically within a country, they essentially exist outside its borders for tax purposes.\nCompanies operating within free ports can benefit from deferring the payment of taxes until their products are moved elsewhere, or can avoid them altogether if they bring in goods to store or manufacture on site before exporting them again.‚Äù\n(From: https://amp.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/06/what-is-a-free-port-all-you-need-to-know-about-free-trade-zones-brexit )\n\nStolen and looted art and artifacts have been known to be trafficked and stored in free ports until they weren‚Äôt ‚Äòhot‚Äô anymore.\n\n‚ÄúThe European Commission in a report said that free ports were popular for the storage of art, precious stones, antiques, gold and wine as alternative assets to cash, and posed an emerging threat in multiple ways: allowing counterfeiters to land consignments and tamper with loads and paperwork, then re-export the products without customs formalities, disguising the actual origin and nature of the goods and their supplier. The commission said they were also used for narcotics trafficking, the illegal ivory trade, people smuggling, VAT fraud, corruption and money laundering.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs an example the commission cited Swiss authorities' 2016 seizure of cultural relics looted from the Middle East being stored in Geneva's free ports. The free port system has been accused of facilitating international art crime, allowing stolen artworks to remain undetected in storage for decades.‚Äù\n\n(From Wikipedia - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_economic_zone)",

        "@Allen Smith. {aAffect.} I don't know why I'm doing this, since every time I use facts and truth to try to convince you people it never works and you just end up doing some incredible mental gymnastics to spare your ego and convince yourself you're still right somehow but HERE GOES! First let me address the last thing you said, name calling doesn't get us anywhere... Perhaps you're right, but tell that to Trump! All he ever does is call people names and insult them! He comes up with cute little nicknames for everyone that opposes him, like pocahontas and mini mike.

And as far as the first thing you said, did you read the comment I responded to?! IT CALLED JOE BIDEN A CRIMINAL AND HIS FAMILY A CRIME FAMILY!

The character dubbed God in the bible, according to the bible, has done the most heinous acts imaginable, and is called \"perfect\" (man made this character in their own image). But historically, scientifically, and logic-wise, there is no credibility for the large majority of events said to have happened in the bible. Plus, the bible tries to make amoral things, moral, by saying \"God said so.\" \n\nI recommend: www.skepticsannotatedbible.com\n\nAnd, if you can watch South Park without batting too much of an eyelid, and are also willing to look up the stories referenced here in the bible itself, here's one of several animations that ought to wake some sense in you (after reading the bible) too: \n\n\"The Most Bizarre Bible Story\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ1GJeYK0A",

That is so far from the truth, so spitefully hurtful of a lie, that most respectable people, be they Democrats or Republicans, refuse to even acknowledge such vitriolic slander.

The character dubbed God in the bible, according to the bible, has done the most heinous acts imaginable, and is called \"perfect\" (man made this character in their own image). But historically, scientifically, and logic-wise, there is no credibility for the large majority of events said to have happened in the bible. Plus, the bible tries to make amoral things, moral, by saying \"God said so.\" \n\nI recommend: www.skepticsannotatedbible.com\n\nAnd, if you can watch South Park without batting too much of an eyelid, and are also willing to look up the stories referenced here in the bible itself, here's one of several animations that ought to wake some sense in you (after reading the bible) too: \n\n\"The Most Bizarre Bible Story\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ1GJeYK0A",

        "Doug, I have a charity for you. It would mean so much to me if you could feature the charity \"To Write Love On Her Arms.\" \n\n\"To Write Love on Her Arms is a non-profit movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide. TWLOHA exists to encourage, inform, inspire, and also to invest directly into treatment and recovery.\"\n\n\n\n During this pandemic, people really need hope, and a safe place to turn. TWLOHA gave me that when I have been in my darkest places. My daughter even has the middle name Renee after the woman that TWLOHA was inspired by. \nThanks for taking the time to look it over! \nhttps://twloha.com/",
        "I didn't like how political it was(morals in cartoons are great but politics in kids cartoons is bad). The \"Goodnight Everybody\" jokes felt forced. The complex female cast is missing (please refer to 2:58 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszVJI-IX9I). Should have been just called The Warners & Pinky and the Brain. 3/10 please stop killing my childhood.",

        "23:40 Being Russian citizen who often watches, analyzes and criticizes Russian media (and currently 99% of it is govt controlle propaganda), I have absolutely no issue with how Animaniacs portrayed it. The state of media in, now AGAIN,  totalitarian country is absolute garbage in every single category. Life is sad, grey, people are hopeless or brainwashed to the maximum, food is garbage and life has no color. There's a reason vast majority of young people in Russia are looking for a way to immigrate. Have fun with this accurate report from 2019 but let me tell you, things have gotten 10 times worse since then... https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RUSSIA-2019-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf"

The girls show possessives  and jelousy  in degrees much bigger than Ron. \nBesides Ron‚Äôs jealousy only comes from on how much time he spends with her.

I'd recommend you check these out and www.rzim.org. \nhttps://youtu.be/wjmFm8PIz8M\nhttps://youtu.be/MY8Nfzcn1qQ\nThere is a God but the devil has you deceived into thinking neither him nor God exist. With respect I'm not looking to open up the debate again as a lot seems to have been fleshed out already. There is enough proof out there if a person chooses to believe it, most people don't as they don't want to have to be accountable to anyone but themselves or lies of the devil deceiving them (biggest deception is convincing people he doesn't exist). I'm just responding to one of your earlier comments.",
